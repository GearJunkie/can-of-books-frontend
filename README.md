# Project Name

**Author**: Gina Hobbs and Jesse Dills
**Version**: 1.0.0 (increment the patch/fix version number if you make more commits past your first submission)

## Overview
<!-- Provide a high level overview of what this application is and why you are building it, beyond the fact that it's an assignment for this class. (i.e. What's your problem domain?) -->

## Getting Started
<!-- What are the steps that a user must take in order to build this app on their own machine and get it running? -->

## Architecture
<!-- Provide a detailed description of the application design. What technologies (languages, libraries, etc) you're using, and any other relevant design information. -->

## Change Log
<!-- Use this area to document the iterative changes made to your application as each feature is successfully implemented. Use time stamps. Here's an example:

01-01-2001 4:59pm - Application now has a fully-functional express server, with a GET route for the location resource. -->

## Credit and Collaborations
<!-- Give credit (and a link) to other people or resources that helped you build this application. -->

# Collaboration Agreement

## Logistical

1. What hours will you be available to communicate?
Normal lab hours with some mornings as necessary, and even going an hour or so past lab each night. We will discuss availability that day.

2. What platform will you use to communicate (ie. Slack, phone …)?
Slack

3. How often will you take breaks?
An evening break to walk the dogs, etc.

4. What is your plan if you start to fall behind?
Early mornings often! Get TA help early.

## Cooperative

1. Make a list of each person’s strengths.
Gina: Good at looking through docs and troubleshooting
Jesse: A good eye for catching syntax errors, good at interpreting the problem domain

2. How can you best utilize these strengths in the development of your application?
By communicating our ideas and working together.

3. In what areas do you each want to develop greater strength?
Gina: I want to build up stamina for sitting at the computer for the whole lab
Jesse: I would like to retain and apply what I am learning faster

4. Knowing that every person in your team needs to understand the code, how do you plan to approach the day-to-day development?
We both have an undestanding that there's no man left behind so we both need to understand. We'll also have a morning standup and code-review.

## Conflict Resolution

1. What will your team do if one person is pulling all the weight while the other person is not contributing?
We both don't feel this would be a problem. If it is a problem we will each come to the person other person first and if it is still an issue we will go the professor for a private chat.

2. What will your team do if one person is taking over the project and not letting the other member contribute?
We don't see this being a problem either. Neither of us are being a dictator and we plan on working together.

3. How will you approach each other and the challenge of building an application knowing that it is impossible for two people to be at the exact same place in understanding and skill level?
It all comes down to communication. We will each try our best to make sure we are at the same level collectively instead of just our personal level.
